### Why `imperius`

### Installation

#### Mac OSX
    brew tap p4tin/tap
    brew install imperius

#### Linux
We have provide a `deb` and `rpm` package that can be installed just like any others just download the version you want from the `releases` section on github and run the installer as normal and you are done.

#### Windows
I apologize but I have no easy installation for windows users.  Simply download the executable `*.tar.gz` for windows, unpack it and place the imperius.exe in your path somewhere and you are all set.
